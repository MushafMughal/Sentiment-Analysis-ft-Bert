# Sentiment Analysis with BERT
This repository demonstrates a Sentiment Analysis pipeline using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The goal is to classify text into multiple sentiment categories (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral). The repository integrates robust preprocessing techniques, efficient data handling, and state-of-the-art deep learning practices.

# Key Features
### Preprocessing Techniques:

  - Contraction Expansion: Expands shortened word forms (e.g., can't â†’ cannot).
  - Emoji Handling: Converts emojis into descriptive text (e.g., ðŸ˜„ â†’ smile).
  - Custom Stop Words Removal: Handles domain-specific stopwords and removes unnecessary ones.
  - URL, Mentions, and Hashtags Removal: Cleans text for better model understanding.
  - Special Characters Filtering: Retains only relevant punctuation and text.

### Deep Learning with Transformers:

 - Utilizes **BERT-base-uncased** model for sequence classification.
 - Fine-tuning for a multi-class classification task (three sentiment labels: Positive, Neutral, Negative).

### Advanced Training Techniques:

  - Learning Rate Scheduler: Implements a linear decay scheduler with warm-up steps for optimized learning.
  - Gradient Clipping: Stabilizes training by avoiding exploding gradients.
  - Dropout Regularization: Introduces a hidden layer dropout of 0.3 for better generalization.
  - Early Stopping: Monitors validation loss to prevent overfitting.


### Evaluation Metrics:

  - Accuracy Score: Measures overall classification performance.
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score: Evaluates performance for individual sentiment classes.
  - Confusion Matrix: Visualizes classification errors and distributions.

### Visualization:

  - Plots training and validation loss to track the modelâ€™s learning process over epochs.

# How It Works

### Preprocessing:

  - Cleans and prepares text data using custom preprocessing functions to enhance model input.

### Dataset Handling:

 - SentimentDataset: Custom PyTorch Dataset for tokenizing text and preparing input features (input_ids, attention_mask, labels).
 - DataLoader: Efficiently batches data for training and validation.

### Training:

 - Fine-tunes the BERT model with a cross-entropy loss function.
 - Tracks performance metrics during training and validates after each epoch.
 - Saves the best-performing model based on validation loss.

### Evaluation:

 - Loads the best saved model for testing.
 - Outputs detailed classification metrics and confusion matrix.

# Performance
 - Model Accuracy: **85.32%**

# Future Enhancements

### Integrate Additional Contextual Embeddings:

 - Incorporate models like RoBERTa, DistilBERT, or ALBERT to explore their effectiveness in sentiment analysis.
 - Compare accuracy, F1-score, and inference time across these models to identify the most optimal one.

### Implement Hyperparameter Tuning:

 - Use Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters such as:
    - Learning rate.
    - Batch size.
    - Maximum sequence length.
    - Dropout rates.
 - Automate the process using libraries like Optuna or Ray Tune.

### Extend Multi-lingual Support:

 - Leverage mBERT or XLM-RoBERTa to handle sentiment analysis in multiple languages.
 - Design preprocessing techniques to accommodate multi-lingual datasets (e.g., handling special characters or different scripts).

### Enhance Accuracy and Generalization:

 - Data Augmentation:
     - Introduce synthetic variations in training data (e.g., synonym replacement, paraphrasing).
 - Class Imbalance Handling:
     - Use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class-weight adjustments in the loss function to handle skewed datasets.

 - Ensemble Methods:
     - Combine predictions from multiple fine-tuned transformers to boost accuracy.

 - Knowledge Distillation:
     - Use a larger teacher model to train a smaller, faster student model while retaining accuracy.
